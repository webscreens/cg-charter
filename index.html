      Goals
    </h2>
    <p>
      The <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/webscreens/">Second Screen
      Community Group (CG)</a> explores the use of secondary screens from Web
      pages. We propose that this Community Group incubate and develop
      specifications of network protocols that implement the <a href=
      "https://w3c.github.io/presentation-api/">Presentation API</a> and the
      <a href="https://w3c.github.io/remote-playback/">Remote Playback API</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This work has three primary purposes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <em>Enable interoperability among implementations of the Presentation
        API.</em> All browsers and displays that implement the specifications
        should be able to act as <a href=
        "https://www.w3.org/TR/presentation-api/#dfn-controlling-user-agent">controlling
        user agents</a> or <a href=
        "https://www.w3.org/TR/presentation-api/#dfn-receiving-user-agent">receiving
        user agents</a> for the Presentation API, with strong security and
        authentication for the data exchanged among them. Interoperability
        among controllers and receivers will increase the number of
        opportunities for the Presentation API to be useful. Interoperability
        will also create more uniform and predictable API behavior across user
        agents, encouraging adoption of the Presentation API by Web developers.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Encourage implementation of the Presentation API by browser
        vendors.</em> The specifications should reduce the design work required
        to implement the Presentation API in a user agent.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Establish complementary specifications for the Presentation
        API.</em> The Presentation API, by nature of its scope, leaves many
        network details up to the implementation. This includes how
        presentation displays are discovered, how presentations are started,
        connected, and stopped, and how the controller and receiver
        communicate. The specifications will provide details on how the
        implementation requirements of the Presentation API can be met and will
        clarify implementation issues that are not addressed in the
        Presentation API specification itself.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The scope of work proposed here goes beyond the current <a href=
      "http://www.w3.org/2014/secondscreen/charter.html#scope">scope</a> of the
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/2014/secondscreen/">Second Screen Working
      Group (WG)</a>. Given wider support and adequate stability, we plan to
      migrate the proposals generated in this Community Group to an appropriate
      standards track, for example the <a href=
      "https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2026#section-4">IETF Standards Track</a>
      or a <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/activities#Working">W3C
      Working Group</a>, for further contributions and formal standardization.
    </p>
    <p>
      Membership of the group is open to everybody. Upon joining the group,
      participants agree to the terms of the <a href=
      "https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/">W3C Community
      Contributor License Agreement (CLA)</a>.
    </p>
    <h2 id="background">
      Background
    </h2>
    <p>
      Under the <a href=
      "https://github.com/webscreens/presentation-api/wiki/Second-Screen-Community-Group-Charter">
      previous charter</a>, the Second Screen Community Group (CG) delivered
      the <a href=
      "http://www.w3.org/2014/secondscreen/presentation-api/20141118/">Presentation
      API Community Group Final Report</a> Specification that provides an API
      for a Web page to display and control content on a secondary screen. The
      work was migrated to the W3C Second Screen Working Group (WG) and the
      Community Group Final Report was provided as input to the <a href=
      "https://w3c.github.io/presentation-api/">Presentation API</a> that is
      now being developed in the WG.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Presentation API allows web applications to use secondary screens to
      display Web content. The initiating HTML page can request display of an
      HTML page on the second screen with a messaging channel between the two
      pages to enable communication and control. The two pages can both be
      rendered on the controlling user agent with just the video display sent
      to the second device ("1-UA mode"), or the second page can be rendered
      independently on the receiving user agent ("2-UA mode").
    </p>
    <p>
      The Presentation API abstracts away the means of connecting as well as
      the underlying communication and video streaming technologies.
    </p>
    <h2 id="scope-of-work">
      Scope of Work
    </h2>
    <p>
      The following tasks are in scope for the work of the community group.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>The specification of a set of network protocols that allows one user
      agent to use the Presentation API to discover and present Web content on
      another user agent, when both user agents are connected to the same Local
      Area Network (LAN).
      </li>
      <li>Protocols that implement all of the interfaces, attributes, methods,
      algorithms, and implementation requirements of the Presentation API are
      in scope. This includes protocols that preserve the privacy and security
      of data exchanged between the controlling and receiving user agents.
      </li>
      <li>The 2-UA mode of the Presentation API is in scope, so the focus will
      be on establishing presentations on a distinct receiving user agent. In
      2-UA mode, the receiving user agent renders the presented document
      independently and messages between documents are exchanged via the
      network.
      </li>
      <li>Protocols that implement all of the interfaces, attributes, methods,
      algorithms, and implementation requirements of the Remote Playback API
      are also in scope, for the specific case of remotely playing a
      <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> element with a
      <code>src</code> or <code>source</code>s URL media source on a presentation
      display. (In the Remote Playback API, this is referred to as the 
      media flinging" case.)
      </li>
      <li>Extension points for protocols developed are in scope, to make it
      possible to add new features via future specifications produced outside
      of this community group. For example, features such as 1-UA mode that are
      out of scope for this community group may be supported through future
      protocol extensions.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Where possible, the group will use established normative standards as a
      basis for specifications to reduce the scope of work. For example, local
      area discovery could be implemented via <a href=
      "https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6762">Multicast DNS</a>.
    </p>
    <h2 id="out-of-scope">
      Out of Scope
    </h2>
    <p>
      For this community group, the following tasks are out of scope.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Additions to the APIs defined in the Second Screen WG are out of
      scope other than what is necessary to implement those APIs by remoting
      requests to the second user agent. Defining media codecs or new
      specifications for transmitting media codecs is out of scope.
      </li>
      <li>Protocols that implement 1-UA mode for the Presentation API are not
      in scope.
      </li>
      <li>Protocols that implement the Remote Playback API for HTML media that
      uses <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/media-source/">Media Source
      Extensions</a> or <a href=
      "https://www.w3.org/TR/encrypted-media/">Encrypted Media Extensions</a>
      are not in scope.
      </li>
      <li>Protocols that support use of presentation displays connected by
      technologies other than IPv4/IPv6 local area networks are not in scope.
      Protocols that allow interaction between controlling and receiving user
      agents on different local area networks (i.e., firewall or NAT traversal)
      are not in scope.
      </li>
      <li>Developing specifications for use of the Presentation API with
      proprietary presentation display network protocols such as DIAL, DLNA,
      Google Cast, MiraCast, or Airplay are not in scope.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="deliverables">
      Deliverables
    </h2>
    <p>
      <strong>The group will only produce Specifications listed in this
      section</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Community Group will deliver specifications designed to meet the
      <a href="requirements.md">functional and security requirements</a> of the
      Presentation API and the Remote Playback API.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>A specification for controlling and receiving user agents that
      describes how the controlling user agent will find available presentation
      displays on the local area network and establish two-way communication
      with one of them. It also describes how the controlling user agent will
      authenticate the receiving user agent and establish a confidential
      communication channel.
      </li>
      <li>A specification for controlling and receiving user agents that
      describes how a controlling user agent may start, connect, stop and
      exchange messages with a presentation on a receiving user agent via the
      Presentation API.
      </li>
      <li>A specification for controlling and receiving user agents that
      describes how a controlling user agent may start and control remote
      playback via the Remote Playback API.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      To add any additional specifications, this Charter must be amended by the
      process described in the <a href="#charter-change">Amendments to the
      Charter</a> section. All deliverables for which the CLA <a href=
      "https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/#id3">Patents</a>
      section applies must be designated as such here.

    <p>
      The group may produce other Community Group Reports within the scope of
      this charter but that are not Specifications, for instance use cases,
      requirements, or white papers.
    </p>
    <h2 id="liaisons">
      Dependencies or Liaisons
    </h2>
    <p>
      It is anticipated that the group will collaborate with appropriate W3C
      Working Groups in order to transition specification proposals to the
      Recommendation Track.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>This group works closely with the <a href=
      "http://www.w3.org/2014/secondscreen/">W3C Second Screen Working
      Group</a>.
      </li>
      <li>There are no external specifications that must be created before the
      Specification(s) to be developed in this group can be completed.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="process">
      Community and Business Group Process
    </h2>
    <p>
      The group operates under the <a href=
      "https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/">Community and Business
      Group Process</a>. Terms in this Charter that conflict with those of the
      Community and Business Group Process are void.
    </p>
    <p>
      As with other Community Groups, W3C seeks organizational licensing
      commitments under the <a href=
      'http://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/'>W3C Community
      Contributor License Agreement (CLA)</a>. When people request to
      participate without representing their organization's legal interests,
      W3C will in general approve those requests for this group with the
      following understanding: W3C will seek and expect an organizational
      commitment under the CLA starting with the individual's first request to
      make a contribution to a group <a href="#deliverables">Deliverable</a>.
      The section on <a href="#contrib">Contribution Mechanics</a> describes
      how W3C expects to monitor these contribution requests.
    </p>
    <h2 id="worklimit">
      Work Limited to Charter Scope
    </h2>
    <p>
      The group will not publish Specifications on topics other than those
      listed under <a href="#specifications">Specifications</a> above. See
      below for <a href="#charter-change">how to modify the charter</a>.
    </p>
    <h2 id="contrib">
      Contribution Mechanics
    </h2>
    <p>
      Substantive Contributions to Specifications can only be made by Community
      Group Participants who have agreed to the <a href=
      "http://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/">W3C Community
      Contributor License Agreement (CLA)</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Specifications created in the Community Group must use the <a href=
      "http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2015/copyright-software-and-document">
      W3C Software and Document License</a>. All other documents produced by
      the group should use that License where possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Community Group participants agree to make all contributions in the
      GitHub repo the group is using for the particular document. This may be
      in the form of a pull request (preferred), by raising an issue, or by
      adding a comment to an existing issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      All Github repositories attached to the Community Group must contain a
      copy of the <a href=
      "https://github.com/w3c/licenses/blob/master/CG-CONTRIBUTING.md">CONTRIBUTING</a>
      and <a href=
      "https://github.com/w3c/licenses/blob/master/CG-LICENSE.md">LICENSE</a>
      files.
    </p>
    <h2 id="transparency">
      Transparency
    </h2>
    <p>
      The group will conduct all of its technical work in public. All technical
      work will occur in its GitHub repositories (and not in mailing list
      discussions). This is to ensure contributions can be tracked through a
      software tool.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meetings may be restricted to Community Group participants, but a public
      summary or minutes must be posted to the group's public mailing list and
      <a href=
      "https://www.w3.org/community/webscreens/wiki/Main_Page">Wiki</a>.
    </p>
    <h2 id="decision">
      Decision Process
    </h2>
    <p>
      This group will seek to make decisions where there is consensus. Groups
      are free to decide how to make decisions (e.g. Participants who have
      earned Committer status for a history of useful contributions assess
      consensus, or the Chair assesses consensus, or where consensus isn't
      clear there is a Call for Consensus [CfC] to allow multi-day online
      feedback for a proposed course of action). It is expected that
      participants can earn Committer status through a history of valuable
      contributions as is common in open source projects. After discussion and
      due consideration of different opinions, a decision should be publicly
      recorded (where GitHub is used as the resolution of an Issue).
    </p>
    <p>
      If substantial disagreement remains (e.g. the group is divided) and the
      group needs to decide an Issue in order to continue to make progress, the
      Committers will choose an alternative that had substantial support (with
      a vote of Committers if necessary). Individuals who disagree with the
      choice are strongly encouraged to take ownership of their objection by
      taking ownership of an alternative fork. This is explicitly allowed (and
      preferred to blocking progress) with a goal of letting implementation
      experience inform which spec is ultimately chosen by the group to move
      ahead with.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any decisions reached at any meeting are tentative and should be recorded
      in a GitHub Issue for groups that use GitHub and otherwise on the group's
      public mail list. Any group participant may object to a decision reached
      at an online or in-person meeting within 10 days of publication of the
      decision provided that they include clear technical reasons for their
      objection. The Chairs will facilitate discussion to try to resolve the
      objection according to the <a href="#decision">decision process</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the Chairs' responsibility to ensure that the decision process is
      fair, respects the consensus of the CG, and does not unreasonably favour
      or discriminate against any group participant or their employer.
    </p>
    <h2 id="chairs">
      Chair Selection
    </h2>
    <p>
      Participants in this group choose their Chair(s) and can replace their
      Chair(s) at any time using whatever means they prefer. However, if 5
      participants, no two from the same organisation, call for an election,
      the group must use the following process to replace any current Chair(s)
      with a new Chair, consulting the Community Development Lead on election
      operations.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Participants announce their candidacies. Participants have 14 days to
      announce their candidacies, but this period ends as soon as all
      participants have announced their intentions. If there is only one
      candidate, that person becomes the Chair. If there are two or more
      candidates, there is a vote. Otherwise, nothing changes.
      </li>
      <li>Participants vote. Participants have 21 days to vote for a single
      candidate, but this period ends as soon as all participants have voted.
      The individual who receives the most votes, no two from the same
      organisation, is elected chair. In case of a tie, a process requested
      from the Community Development Lead is used to break the tie. An elected
      Chair may appoint co-Chairs.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Participants dissatisfied with the outcome of an election may ask the
      Community Development Lead to intervene. The Community Development Lead,
      after evaluating the election, may take any action including no action.
    </p>
    <h2 id="charter-change">
      Amendments to this Charter
    </h2>
    <p>
      The group can decide to work on a proposed amended charter, editing the
      text using the <a href="#decision">Decision Process</a> described above.
      The decision on whether to adopt the amended charter is made by
      conducting a 30-day vote on the proposed new charter. The new charter, if
      approved, takes effect on either the proposed date in the charter itself,
      or 7 days after the result of the election is announced, whichever is
      later. A new charter must receive 2/3 of the votes cast in the approval
      vote to pass. The group may make simple corrections to the charter such
      as deliverable dates by the simpler group decision process rather than
      this charter amendment process. The group will use the amendment process
      for any substantive changes to the goals, scope, deliverables, decision
      process or rules for amending the charter.
